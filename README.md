# 🥁 Tap the Beat

A simple game to train your beat sense

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `yarn dev`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- `yarn test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode
- `yarn build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Folder Structure

I decided to structure the application based on domains. Please note that currently this little app has only one domain: `game`.

`shared` is a directory dedicated to anything not related to any domains.
